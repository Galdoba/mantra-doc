Jump travel covers the method by which ships can travel the enormous distances needed to journey to other star systems with relative speed. Other methods of star travel are covered in [[High Guard]].

Jump travel is the only known means by which a vessel may travel faster than light. To jump, a ship creates a bubble of hyperspace by means of injecting high-energy exotic particles into an artificial singularity. The singularity is driven out of our universe, creating a tiny parallel universe that is then blown up like a balloon by injecting hydrogen into it. The jump bubble is folded around the ship, carrying it into the little pocket universe.

This new universe is short-lived and will eventually collapse, precipitating the ship back into normal space several light-years from its original position.

A ship can only safely jump when it is more than 100 diameters distant from any object larger than the ship. A vessel could only jump away from Earth, for example, when it is more than 1.27 million kilometres distant (as well as 140 million kilometres away from Sol and 300,000 kilometres away from the Moon). Gravity can cause a jump bubble to collapse prematurely, bringing a ship back into normal space early – so, if a ship tried to jump from Earth to Mars when the Sun was between the two, the vessel would fall out of jump space as soon as it came within 100 diameters of the Sun.

### The Jump Drive
The standard means of interstellar travel in the Third Imperium universe is the jump drive. This translates the vessel into an alternate place or state, a private pocket universe just for that ship. A jump is generally considered to take approximately 150–180 hours (roughly a week) and covers up to one parsec (a parsec is 3.27 light years) per jump number per week – i.e. a jump-3 ship can transit up to three parsecs (9.81 light years) in a week during a normal jump.

A standard jump drive uses fuel equal to 10% of the tonnage of the vessel per parsec. Thus a 500-ton jump-3 ship needs 50 tons of fuel per parsec and can jump one to three parsecs at a time. It is possible to carry fuel for multiple jumps but there are practical limits on how much of a ship can be given over to fuel tankage.

Jump travel is not without its hazards. Even a well-maintained vessel on a known route can suffer a misjump. A minor misjump might shorten or lengthen the duration of the jump and/or change its direction and distance by a huge amount. More serious misjumps can damage or destroy a ship as well as altering the exit point. There are also tales of very strange things happening in jumpspace, including unintelligible radio signals and strange phenomena that can drive crewmembers insane. In the Third Imperium universe the jump drive obeys certain well-understood rules:
- A jump takes approximately seven days, typically plus or minus a day, and a jump capable vessel can cover any distance up to the ship’s jump number in parsecs in that time.
- A jump requires fuel equal to 10% of the ship’s mass per parsec.
- The ship is completely cut off from the outside universe whilst in jumpspace.
- Jumping within a gravity well is dangerous.

## Preaparing for jump
To jump, the following procedures must be performed as a task chain using Astrogation and Engineer (j-drive) checks.

**Astrogation:** The jump needs to be plotted. This is an Easy (4+) Astrogation check (1D x 10 minutes, EDU), modified by the jump distance (thus, a jump covering four parsecs gives DM-4 to the check). If the check is failed, then the astrogator must plot the jump again. Astrogation can be done in advance (a jump is normally plotted while the ship is travelling out to the 100-diameter distance).

**Jump!:** Firing the jump drive requires an Easy (4+) Engineer (j-drive) check (1D x 10 minutes, EDU), modified by the task chain of the original Astrogation check and the following modifiers.
- Jump drive not maintained: DM-1 per month behind maintenance
- Using unrefined fuel: DM-2
- Still within the 100-diameter limit: DM-4
- Still within the 10-diameter limit: DM-8
If this check is failed, then the ship misjumps.

**Divert Power:** A jump drive requires a tremendous amount of power to function, which must be supplied by the ship’s power plant. On many vessels, especially older ships, the power plant strains to provide this much, leading to the tradition of ‘jump dimming’ where non-essential systems including lighting is shut down to allow for jump. If insufficient Power is available, the jump drive cannot be activated.

## Jump travel
When making a jump, a ship will use an amount of fuel equal to 10% of its hull tonnage for every parsec jumped. For example, if a 200-ton ship makes a two parsec jump, it will require 40 tons of fuel (10% of 200 tons = 20, multiplied by two parsecs = 40 tons).

A jump carries the vessel a number of parsecs equal to the jump number. Jumps of less than one parsec (less than three light years or one hex on a sector map) are possible and count as jump-1 for the purposes of Astrogation checks and fuel expenditure. Regardless of how far the ship jumps, it always stays in jumpspace for roughly one week.

While in jumpspace, the ship is completely and utterly cut off from the universe. It hangs in a shimmering bubble of boiling hydrogen, a pocket dimension from which nothing can escape. It cannot communicate with the normal universe, not even by psionic means. It is utterly alone.

When the ship exits jumpspace after an accurate jump, it tends to arrive close to the target world but outside or on the verge of the 100-diameter limit. Inaccurate jumps dump the ship somewhere in the inner system, requiring a long space flight.

## Jump masking
Using the jump drive is never without at least some risk but hazards can be minimised by following certain guidelines. Most spacers will not even consider engaging a jump drive when within 100 diameters of a planet, star, or other massive object. Even something as small as another ship can cause a serious misjump incident.

The 100-diameter limit is more a useful rule of thumb than physical law. A very dense but small object has sufficient gravity to make jumps hazardous beyond 100 diameters. However, for an average rocky planet the 100-diameter rule is a good guideline. Most spacers calculate a safe jump as ‘100 plus a bit’. Jumping within 10 diameters of a massive object is extremely dangerous and would only be attempted in the most desperate of circumstances.

A jump whose emergence point is too close to an object with strong gravity can have serious consequences. Whilst it is possible (but very risky) to jump from within 100 diameters of an object, it is not usually possible to jump directly into an area ‘masked’ by the 100-diameter limit of an object. Occasionally a ship does emerge within this limit but this causes damage to the jump drive and can sometimes cause a ship to disintegrate on emergence.

It is not possible to hit a precise emergence point within the 100-diameter limit. Most commonly, attempting to do so will cause the ship to precipitate out of jump (with damage to the drive) at the 100 diameter limit. Sometimes the ship will misjump instead and end up somewhere entirely different. The duration of the jump is not affected by any shortening of the distance covered due to jump masking – it is not possible to make a jump in a couple of days by aiming for a distant point and being precipitated out of jump by an intervening object.

Jump masking has some important implications for interstellar travel. A star like our sun has a 100-diameter limit of about 140,000,000 kilometres, or a little less than one Astronomical Unit. This means that virtually every location in the solar system inside Earth’s orbit is masked by the sun. In other words it is not possible to jump directly to Mercury or Venus; the only way to get there is by sublight travel.

Very large stars mask huge volumes of space. A giant star might have a diameter of 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 kilometres, and would mask an area 100 times greater. Even the outer planets might be masked, requiring a long transit to and from a safe jump point. Systems with multiple stars may also experience significant jump masking, with some worlds having periods when they are masked and others when they are not as a result of relative orbital positions.

Calculating the masked radius for a gas giant requires a definition of its radius, which is usually taken as the point at which atmospheric pressure reaches 1 atmosphere. For a large gas giant (e.g. Jupiter) this is around 60- 70,000 kilometres. For a small gas giant (e.g. Uranus or Neptune), a figure of around 25,000 kilometres is common. This means that a small gas giant has a 100-diameter limit of some 2,500,000 kilometres; for a large gas giant it will be around 6,500,000 kilometres.

This has implications for shipping to a port located on a gas giant moon. The moons of Jupiter have orbital radii ranging from 128,000 kilometres to 24,000,000 kilometres, with the larger moons being closer in. It is possible that a mainworld that is also a gas giant moon would be masked, requiring ships to make a long transit in and out from the jump point. This might have strategic advantages but it adds time to a merchant ship’s trip which will harm trade, stunting economic growth of a world located there, unless it was sufficiently rich in resources to be a must-go trade destination.

Jumping within 100 diameters of an object imposes DM-4 on Engineer (j-drive) checks, and jumping within 10 diameters imposes DM-8. It is still possible to make such a jump and survive… possible, but not likely.

Lagrange points, where the gravity of two objects create a net zero force, are actually subject to greater gravitational forces than normal – the fact that two forces cancel one another out does not mean there is no force on a ship jumping at that point. It is extremely dangerous to jump from a Lagrange point; an additional DM-2 is applied to Engineer checks on top of the normal DM for jumping within a gravity well.

The main implication of jump masking is to create areas where starships must proceed at sublight speeds, making them vulnerable to piracy and other hazards. Worlds within a jump-masked area are likely to be less economically developed than those with quicker access to interstellar trade, although this does not mean all jump-masked worlds are backward.

Jump-masked worlds and gas giant moons are an ideal location for sensitive outposts, prisons and bases. Traffic volume will be lower due to the difficulty of getting to and from the location, and if there is an attempt to attack or escape from the installation the warning time will be greater. Jump-masked areas of a star system are often largely forgotten about – many spacers have a blind spot towards places they cannot easily go – and so make ideal hiding places for pirates or secret caches.

## Jump Precipitation
Jump precipitation can occur if a plot is too tight and the ship hits the 100-diameter limit before emergence, or if the jump shadow of an unpredicted object lies across the vessel’s path. This usually happens due to very poor astrogation, creating a path which takes the ship through the 100-diameter shadow of a star or planet. It can also occur if there is an uncharted object such as a rogue planet on the ship’s course. A vessel would have to be very unlucky to be precipitated out of jump by a comet or other relatively small object, but it does happen from time-to-time.

A ship that is precipitated out of jump in this manner still takes the normal time for a jump; it just does not go as far. Thus a vessel attempting a six-parsec jump but is precipitated out of jumpspace by an object encountered 1.5 parsecs from the starting point still takes the normal time for the jump. The crew may have no warning that this has occurred until they re-enter normal space.

## Jump Variance
When a jump is plotted, the astrogator attempts to refine all of the vastly complex calculations and variables involved into a ‘jump plot’ that will bring the vessel out as close to the 100-diameter limit of the destination as possible. The ship’s engineer then attempts to implement the plot in such a way as to get as close as possible to the astrogator’s theoretical model. Jump navigation is not a 100% precise science however and there will always be some variance.

Assuming the plot from the astrogator and entry into jumpspace set up by the engineer are both good (both skill checks are made) then the vessel will arrive a safe margin short of the 100-diameter emergence limit after approximately 168 hours +/- 20 hours.

| 2D  | Distance Variance (+Astrogators's Effect) | Time Variance (+Engineer's Effect) |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 2-  | 110-3D diameters. Bad Jump                | 16D Hours. Bad Jump                |
| 3   | 110-2D diameters. Bad Jump                | 10D Hours. Bad Jump                |

The Distance and Time Variance tables give typical jump characteristics. The Effect of the astrogator’s skill check to set up the jump plot is used as a DM on the Distance Variance table. The Effect of the engineer’s skill check is used as a DM on the Time Variance table. In general, the better the plot and jump entry, the closer the jump will be to baseline parameters. A model jump of exactly normal duration and emergence is at 105 diameters to create a margin of safety, although a very good plot can bring the ship out at exactly the 100 diameter limit and shave some time off the journey.

If the variance indicates the emergence point is closer to the target than the 100 diameter limit, the vessel is precipitated out of jumpspace at the 100 diameter limit, suffering the effects of jump precipitation. Variance can be long or short. Roll 1D: Odd indicates that the jump is long in duration, even indicates it is short.

## Bad Jumps
Bad jumps are not confined to Misjumps – some systems are notorious for unpleasant jump effects, for no known reason. In other cases, a hurried insertion or decayed jump plot may also merit a bad jump. A decayed plot is a set of jump parameters generated for use under slightly different circumstances (for example, the ship might have significantly changed its speed and heading since the plot was generated) or a plot that is more than 3D hours old. Jump plots are sufficiently complex that they decay quickly. At first this will cause a bad jump; severe decay in the plot will cause a misjump.

If the jump variance rules are in use, ill-effects will be felt by the crew and passengers if either Variance table indicates a Bad Jump. If both tables indicate a Bad Jump, the effects will be magnified as per Very Bad Jumps.

A Bad Jump typically produces a feeling of dislocation and confusion, often accompanied by nausea and headaches, at the moment of entry and some time before emergence. Everyone aboard the vessel must make an END and INT check. One of these checks is at Routine (6+) difficulty and the other at Difficult (10+) difficulty level. A Traveller can choose which check is taken at each difficulty level.

**The END check** determines if physical effects are present. These include nausea and possibly vomiting, plus often a blinding headache. If the END check is failed, all checks the Traveller attempts are subject to a DM equal to the Effect of the failure for 2D hours after entry into jump and again after emergence.

An Effect of -6 or worse indicates the Traveller is incapacitated; unconscious or wishing he was, for 2Dx30 minutes after which a DM-6 applies on all checks for the following 4D hours.

**The INT check** determines if psychological effects are present. These typically include unease, irritability and paranoia, but in some cases can lead to a complete breakdown. Anyone who fails the INT check will be irritable, nervous and generally out of sorts for the whole duration of the jump. This manifests as difficulty in concentrating as well as a tendency to be on edge which often makes interactions with other Travellers unpleasant. DM-2 applies to all checks associated with mental or interpersonal activities. The Traveller will be visibly on edge and may appear to be behaving suspiciously or in a paranoid fashion. Memory lapses, covering a few minutes to an hour or two, are also possible.

An Effect of -6 or worse indicates the Traveller is suffering from serious mental effects. These manifest as acute paranoia, blackouts and hallucinations. A Traveller in this state might harm themselves or someone else, or take a potentially dangerous action such as locking a hatch that the rest of the crew need to access a critical area.

Psychological effects last throughout the jump and for 1D days afterward.

### Very Bad Jumps
If both variance tables indicate a Bad Jump, or the ship misjumps, the effects are magnified. Both checks (INT and END) must be made as above, but DM-2 applies to both. In addition, there may be other effects on the ship and its passengers.

On the Very Bad Jump table, DM-4 applies if Bad Jump was indicated by both variances tables. DM-2 applies if the Very Bad Jump was caused by precipitation due to hitting the 100-diameter limit. Normal misjumps are rolled without DM. DM+2 applies if the ship jumped whilst under significant gravitational effects (typically this means jumping within the 100-diameter limit of an object). DM+4 applies if the ship jumped whilst under serious gravitational effects (typically this means jumping from within the 10-diameter limit of a planet or other body). Only one modifier is used – the Referee should use the highest applicable to the ship.

| 2D    | Effect                                                                     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-    | No additional effects                                                      |
| 3-5   | Jump drive requires lengthy recalibration (taking 2D days) after emergence |
| 6-7   | Jump drive requires minor repairs after emergence                          |
| 8-9   | Jump drive requires major repairs after emergence                          |
| 10-12 | Jumpspace intrusions occur, jump drive destroyed upon emergence            |
| 13+   | Severe jumpspace intrusions occur, jump drive destroyed upon emergence     |

Jumpspace intrusions are extremely serious. The ship’s jump field becomes unstable, allowing pockets of jump space to enter the ship. This will destroy any matter it encounters, such as bulkheads, wiring and Travellers. The intrusions are usually stable, so will be limited to a particular location for the whole of the voyage. However, additional intrusions can occur at any time or existing ones may spread. A ship may be slowly consumed by the intrusions, with Travellers forced to retreat to unbreached compartments and hope the ship emerges into normal space before it is lost entirely.

A ship suffering jumpspace intrusions suffers damage equal to 2D-2 as a percentage of its Hull per day. This matter is completely destroyed, requiring a major rebuild if the ship survives. A severe intrusion consumes 2D+10% of the ship’s Hull per day.

## Misjump
A Misjump occurs if the sum of the Effect achieved by the astrogator and engineer is 0 or less. This means that if one fails their check but the other makes theirs by a greater margin, the Misjump is averted, although in this case the effects of a Bad Jump should be imposed.

If the sum of the Effects is 0 or less, a Misjump has indeed occurred and if both checks are failed a Serious Misjump has happened. All Misjumps are accompanied by the effects of a Bad Jump and Serious Misjumps are accompanied by the effects of a Very Bad Jump. This is in addition to the effects noted on the Misjumps table.

If a Misjump occurs, roll 2D on the Misjumps table below using the combined Effect of the Engineer and Astrogation checks as a DM.

| 2D    | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-    | The ship is lost in jumpspace or emerges as fragments and subatomic particles.                                                                                               |
| 3-4   | The ship misjumps 1D x 1D parsecs in a random direction. Its jump drive is completely wrecked upon emergence and the passengers and crew risk lasting psychological effects. |
| 5-6   | The ship misjumps 2D parsecs in a random direction. Its jump drive is severely damaged upon emergence.                                                                       |
| 7-8   | The ship misjumps 1D parsecs in a random direction.                                                                                                                          |
| 9-10  | Duration increased or decreased by 1D days. Jump drive requires extensive recalibration (D3 days of work) but no repairs.                                                    |
| 11-12 | Very rough jump, emergence is at 100 x 2D diameters from the target world.                                                                                                   |
