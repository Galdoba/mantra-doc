# Components
## Component Grades

The components described in High Guard are the industry standard in much of Charted Space and constructed in a manner enabling them to be used ‘off the shelf’ in many craft. In the Estuary Cluster, the performance of these components is mimicked as best the locals can manage by using a mix of locally available TL8 items and just enough higher technology to create an equivalent. This means that one drive unit will not necessarily be the same as another, although some engineers have their own signature solutions to problems inherent in getting thrust out of locally available components, plus a few TL9–10 bits and pieces. 

On most worlds of the cluster, TL8 is the best that is readily available. There are, however, a few facilities that manufacture TL9 items for spacecraft and installations. It is possible to create facsimiles of TL10–11 equipment using these, although prototypes created in this manner are subject to disadvantages as shown on page 70 of High Guard. 

One important result of this is that ships will not conform to quantised standards in force elsewhere. Some vessels will have thrust ratings measured in decimals and will need to list their thrust potential as well as their current thrust capability. For example, a craft may have been built with a drive capable of 1G thrust but years of hard use have reduced its capability to 0.4G. A device can be brought back up to its original potential by replacing parts but cannot be increased past 1G. 

This requires a decision for spacers. Should they spend time and money on augmenting their ship’s rather feeble thrust back to a level closer to its original potential, or should they save up for a replacement drive with a higher potential? They may be able to buy a drive originally capable of 1.6G cheaply if it has degraded to a significant degree, with the intention of tinkering it to full potential later. 

It is unlikely that the Travellers will be able to buy shipyard-grade components but if they can do so then they can fit standard ship elements such as staterooms and common areas ‘straight out of the book’. More commonly they will need to construct something similar in function out of whatever components are available. The quality of components – which reflects how easy or comfortable they are to use, how they look and how much they will impress or annoy visitors – is rated on the following scale: 

**Busted:** A component in Busted condition does not work at all and is likely only to be useful as a source of spares. It is not possible to construct components in Busted condition – at least, not deliberately – but Busted components can be upgraded to a better condition at double the usual cost in materials. 

**Crude:** The component is a godawful mess of mismatched parts and pieces, and overall is barely functional. Machinery will be highly unreliable, awkward to use and ugly to look at. Bits sticking out in awkward places create trip hazards and opportunities for selfinjury. If enough parts are replaced by something better, it will be possible to elevate the item to Beyond Janky status. Performance will likely be about 10–20% of what a standard component can do, with DM-4 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Beyond Janky:** The component is more than likely on its last legs and does not function very well at all. It can be improved to Janky status by replacing sufficient parts with better items. Performance will likely be about 30–50% of what a standard item can deliver, with DM-3 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Janky:** Janky items are to some extent an industry standard in the cluster. They are ugly, awkward to use and prone to breakdowns. As always, upgrades are possible if the right components are available. Performance is likely to be 60–70% of standard, with DM-2 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Basic:** Basic items are nearly as good as standard, although they lack comfort, ease of use and special features. Performance is likely to be 80–90% of standard, with DM-1 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Standard:** Standard items are as good as what a shipyard would install. 

**Improved:** Improved items are typically as much as 25% better than shipyard-installed items or allow DM+1 to be applied. They are rarely seen in the cluster, although some rich individuals may have created vessels for their personal use which more resemble flying palaces.

**High-Quality:** High-quality items are up to 50% more effective than an equivalent standard component or allow DM+2 to be applied. They are very rare. 

Components will either provide a DM to actions involving their use or operate at a reduced or (rarely) enhanced level. DMs apply to all relevant actions and common sense applies in all cases. 

For example, high-quality cargo space cannot fit more cargo than the same displacement of common old cargo space but if there is cargo handling equipment available it will operate faster and more efficiently. Janky cargo space probably has awkward projections and malfunctioning equipment, imposing a DM on cargo handling operations rather than reducing the amount of cargo that can be hauled – although that is a possibility if some parts of the cargo bay are unusable. 

When a component is to be produced, the amount of materials required to put it together must be determined. Until all these materials are added the component is unfinished and will not be functional. Once completed, the constructor will need to determine its condition. It is possible to spend months putting a power plant together from scavenged parts, only to find it barely functions. All required materials are used up even if the item is not of an acceptable level of functionality at the end of the process. 

The amount of materials required to upgrade a component depends upon its current condition. Upgrading a Busted item to a Crude and minimally functional state requires vastly less materials than improving a Basic one to Standard condition. Upgrading can only be done one level at a time. It might be cheaper in the long run to replace a component than to keep pulling the system apart and making small changes. However, new components are hard to come by.

If it is necessary to determine the quality of a component, for example when salvaging a wreck, a 2D check is made. If the check comes up a straight 12, roll again. On 11+ the component is somehow in a High-Quality state; otherwise it is in an Improved state. 

For example, a Busted component requires only a tenth of the materials to upgrade to Crude status as it would to go from Basic to Standard condition.

|    2D    | Component Condition | Functionality |       DM       | Materials to Upgrade |
| :------: | ------------------- | ------------- | :------------: | :------------------: |
|    2-    | Busted              | 0%            | Non-Functional |         10%          |
|   3-4    | Crude               | 10-20% (15%)  |       -4       |         25%          |
|   5-6    | Beyond Janky        | 30-50 (40%)   |       -3       |         50%          |
|   7-8    | Janky               | 60-70% (65%)  |       -2       |         75%          |
|   9-10   | Basic               | 80-90% (85%)  |       -1       |         100%         |
|    11    | Standard            | 100%          |       0        |         150%         |
|    12    | Improved            | 125%          |       +1       |         250%         |
| 12 (11+) | High-Quality        | 150%          |       +2       |          -           |

## Component Types
Components fall into the following categories: Structural, Utility, Control, Machinery and Drives. Each requires different types of materials in differing proportions to construct or upgrade. 

### Structural 
Structural components include the hull and internal bulkheads. They require only Structural materials. 

### Utility 
Utility components include staterooms and common areas, and other internal systems such as cargo handling cranes, briefing rooms, small craft grapples and other systems. Utility components need structural components but only a trivial amount of electronics. 

### Control 
Control systems are electronics-heavy, requiring a considerable amount of technical components in addition to some structural and outfitting supplies. Control systems include computers, the bridge and also weapons aboard ships that have them.

### Machinery 
Machinery includes all systems that require considerable amounts of electronics as well as structural components. These include power systems and heavy internal machinery such as cargo handling cranes. 

### Drives 
Drives include all types of manoeuvre drive and the jump drive. They are expensive items to maintain and upgrade due to their requirement for a great deal of technical materials. 

# Materials 
Materials fall into three categories: Structural, Technical and Outfitting. Structural materials have a base cost of Cr10000 per unit. Technical materials cost Cr25000 per unit and Outfitting materials cost Cr1000 per unit. These are nominal costs and will vary depending on availability as well as other factors. The Travellers may be able to scavenge materials or loot them from an abandoned stash. 

| Material Type | Base Cost | Cargo Space (per Unit) |
| ------------- | :-------: | :--------------------: |
| Structural    |  Cr10000  |        0.1 Tons        |
| Technical     |  Cr25000  |       0.01 Tons        |
| Outfitting    |  Cr1000   |        0.1 Tons        |


One unit of Structural or Outfitting material takes up 0.1 tons of cargo space and one unit of Technical material takes up 0.01 tons. This may be reduced by careful packing and arrangement but since materials are often chunks of salvage and have irregular shapes the amount of extra materials that can be crammed in is variable and largely dependent on how long the Travellers want to spend on completing the galaxy’s untidiest jigsaw. 

The material requirements to produce or upgrade different types of component depend on the nature of the system. The amount of materials per ton of the item is given on the Material Requirements table.

# Constructing and Upgrading Vessels 
When a vessel is created its baseline Tech Level needs to be assigned. For junkboats and rigs constructed in the Estuary Cluster this will normally be TL9. Even if the vessel contains a number of more advanced items its baseline TL remains the same. Upgrading a vessel to a higher Tech Level is a huge undertaking requiring a major rebuild. If this were to be done for some reason, the vessel’s new baseline Tech Level would be defined by the lowest of its hull, bridge and power plant Tech Level. 

Imported components of up to TL14 are available at Estuary Station, providing authorisation to buy them has been issued or they can be ‘obtained’ in some other manner. It may also be possible to salvage more or less complete components from a wreck. These might be in poor condition but even an item that is in Beyond Janky provides a base upon which to build later. Brave Travellers might decide to install an unreliable, busted-up old jump drive and hope to survive long enough to fix it up. 

A complete component, say a TL14 jump drive, can be installed in a ‘black box’ configuration providing suitable interface devices can be constructed. Installing a complete component requires an Average (8+) Engineer check (INT) with a negative DM equal to the difference between the component’s Tech Level and that of the vessel it is to be installed into. Failing this check reduces the condition of the component by one level but does not preclude a future attempt. 

The costs given in *High Guard* represent what it costs to have a shipyard install that component in your ship. A component can instead be cobbled together from available parts. The maximum TL of components created this way is two TL above what is available locally. In the Estuary Cluster this usually equates to TL11, although there are exceptions. Trying to put together TL11-equivalent systems using TL9 components is quite a challenge. As per page 70 of High Guard, a component one Tech Level above local (TL10) will cost 500% of normal price and have one disadvantage. Two Tech Levels above local (TL11) costs 1,000% of normal price and imposes two disadvantages. It is highly unlikely any local yard will have items of this sort for sale but cost increases also apply to constructing and upgrading components. These increases are applied to the amount of components required when upgrading or constructing higher-tech items. For example, creating a TL10 component from what is available in the Estuary Cluster requires five times as many materials. 

It may be that the Travellers will decide the project is impractical when they find out how many materials they are going to need. They cannot simply roll again straight away but if a new source of materials becomes available there may be something within that bridges one of the project’s gaps. In this case the Referee should allow the project’s material cost to be redetermined. 

For example, a standard 20-ton starship bridge for a 300 ton vessel would cost MCr1.5 to buy new. The Travellers want to construct one from what they can find lying around. They need 2D units of Structural materials, 3D units of Technical materials and 2D units of Outfitting materials per ton of the bridge. Rolling the dice they discover they will need 2 Structural at a cost of Cr10000 per unit, 9 Technical at Cr25000 per unit and 8 Outfitting at Cr1000 per unit. 

The materials cost is Cr253000 per ton, or MCr4.9. This is vastly more than just buying a new bridge and having it installed but if the Travellers have no choice but to build a starship’s control centre from scratch they will get through a lot of materials. They decide this is too expensive and hold off construction for a while. If they can find a new source of materials the Referee may allow them to reroll the amount of, say, Technical parts needed, reflecting the possibility of finding a magnetohydrodynamic torsion controller in working condition and not having to cobble one together out of hundreds of domestic appliances. 

Construction costs can be offset by finding a cheaper source of components, or getting them free. Salvage might yield complete components – which are unlikely to be in good condition – or parts that can be broken down for use elsewhere. It may be possible to obtain components as a reward for completing missions, or to steal them from rivals if the Travellers are that way inclined. 

Once the Travellers have enough of the requisite materials they can attempt to put the component together. This can be done singly or as a group. 

For example, the Travellers might construct a living quarters module consisting of four staterooms and an eight-ton common area. They can be inventive in their description of what they are installing so long as it is plausible. Perhaps they might decide the common area contains the galaxy’s smallest galley, a tiny eating area and a grand piano.

Putting the component together requires a Difficult (10+) Engineer check (INT) with a negative DM equal to the difference in Tech Level of the component and the vessel’s baseline Tech Level. Effect -6 or worse means the Travellers have botched the construction and must start again, losing 2D-2x10% of their materials in the process. Any other result produces a finished component… of sorts. 

The starting condition of the component is determined by a 2D roll on the Component Quality table (see page 35), with a DM equal to the Effect of the Engineer check made to construct it. Only on a straight 12 will the item somehow come out better than intended. A result other than a straight 12, modified to 12+, is treated as 11. 

For example, the Travellers decide to put together the accommodation complex mentioned before. The four staterooms come to 16 tons in total. The common area is eight tons. The material requirement for this complex is 3D Structural and 5D Outfitting materials per ton. The Travellers find they need 11 Structural and 24 Outfitting materials per ton. That comes out at MCr3.216 in materials. Compared to the shipyard cost of MCr2.8 this is not a great deal for a component that might not be in good condition but there are no alternatives. 

The Travellers make their check to see if their component is any good. Their highest Engineer skill gives them DM+2 on their check but the dice are unkind and come up a 5. With DM+2 this is 7, well below the required 10 for the Difficult (10+) Engineer check. They have managed to put together a living area but… yikes! The component quality check is made with DM-3. A roll of 10 looks promising but reduced to 7 this indicates the component the Travellers have built is Janky. It imposes DM-2 on checks to use its facilities and prospective passengers are unlikely to react favourably to it. 

The accommodation complex takes up the same displacement as a standard set of staterooms and common area but has less useable space, mismatched upholstery and freshers that only work when they feel like it. This accommodation block is sufficient to be used by hardy souls but will disappoint most passengers and disgust many. Perhaps it can be upgraded later.

## Work Time and Facility Requirements 
The time required to carry out work is measured in shifts. A shift assumes a competent(ish) person working a normal part of the day, so will be 6–10 hours. Travellers can put in double shifts for a while but eventually fatigue and boredom will set in. The Referee might allow the Travellers to work round the clock in a desperate situation but it is unrealistic to claim that even the most dedicated of crews can work 16-hour days for months on end. 

More commonly a project will proceed at a steady pace, sustainable without an increased risk of accidents or substandard results. Shifts can be staggered so that work is constantly ongoing. How quickly the project proceeds depends on facilities available. 

The hardest way to build or modify craft is to do it while the vessel is in flight, yet this is surprisingly common within the Estuary Cluster. Many vessels proceed about their business with some of their systems dismantled for repair or tinkering with. Even in a parking orbit, work can be extremely difficult without specialist equipment for handling heavy components. 

In this or during other crew-only work, producing or upgrading one ton of components will require 4D+4 shifts, or about three weeks of work for a single person. This assumes that components are available in a form where they can be fitted together rather than having to be constructed from scratch. Ideally, the Travellers will have someone preparing components and getting them to the construction team. Otherwise they will have to take time away from the project to machine and assemble the parts they need. 

A basic construction rig will greatly shorten the process. A basic rig will normally include robots or waldos for handling large components and some kind of framework to assist the assembly process. A salvage rig can also be used for construction. Using a basic construction rig or the equivalent reduces the number of shifts required to 3D+3 per ton of components, or roughly a fortnight of work per ton. A full repair or construction cradle, with robotic units that do most of the actual work, reduces the number of shifts per ton down to 2D+2.

## Installing, salvaging and scavenge components

Salvage can be obtained from wrecks or from vessels so decrepit they are sold for scrap. It may be possible to remove whole components – such as a stateroom or drive system – and install them elsewhere. Removing whole components, even if they have to be dismantled and reconstructed, is quicker than a full salvage job. It will take the same number of shifts to fully scavenge a component as it would to install it and 1D less shifts than this if the component can be removed as a functional unit and reinstalled. In this case it will be in the same condition as when it was in the original vessel if the Engineer check is made and one category worse if it is failed.

| Situation      | Facilities          | Shifts Required |

# Rating a Vessel 

If the Travellers are lucky enough to be crewing a swankboat fresh from the yards, they will use the standard Traveller system for recording their ship. Junkboats and rigs use the same system with additional information. If the Travellers want, they can record the condition of every single component aboard their ship and this may be necessary if they have used a mishmash of different bits and pieces. A ship whose drives are in good condition might also have a good quality stateroom but several others that are barely fit for human occupation. 

It is generally more convenient to note the quality of each general category within the vessel’s systems and to upgrade or replace components in blocks. The Travellers can go into as much detail as they like, bearing in mind that the jankiness of their ship is an important facet of this campaign. The condition of a component imposes a DM on all checks involving its use. 

For ships operated by non-Travellers, it is simplest to assign an overall quality level to the whole vessel, perhaps with one or more systems at a different quality level. DMs apply whenever they seem appropriate. 

For example, if the Travellers are making a first impression with a new client or some dignitary they would prefer to impress, their decrepit deathtrap of a vessel will impose a negative DM on reactions. 

Systems should be rated as blocks that have the same function. 

For example, if a ship has multiple passenger staterooms it is not desirable to rate each separately unless they are of differing quality in which case sub-groups can be created. Likewise specialist systems should be grouped, for example as cargo handling systems, drone operations systems and prospecting systems. 

In the event that a system takes damage it can only be repaired up to its current quality level. Improving it requires taking out the worst components and replacing them with better ones which goes beyond normal repair procedures. It is, however, possible to repair a system by upgrading it. 

For example, a vessel would normally have Hull 100 but it is in Janky condition and currently has Hull 65. Having taken damage in a crash, the vessel’s Hull is reduced to 45. It can be repaired back up to 65 but going beyond this point requires an upgrade. If the parts are available the crew could make a virtue of necessity and rip out the worst of the undamaged hull components along with the damaged ones, rebuilding at Basic quality and increasing to a maximum Hull 85.


## Component Condition
For craft and vessels whose components are in varying conditions, the overall condition of the vessel is determined by hull and power plant. The worst condition of these should be taken as indicative of the overall nonswankiness of the vessel.

### Component Quality Effects


| Component                | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hull                     | Hull is reduced to the percentage indicated by the quality level.                                                                                             |
| Manueuvre Drive          | DM applies to checks required for actions using the drive and Thrust is reduced to the percentage indicated by the quality level.                             |

Constructing a Vessel 
It is entirely possible to put together a space vessel or even a starship without a proper yard. It takes a long time, however, and the end result might not be quite what the builder hoped for. A vessel put together in a yard will come out in Standard condition throughout – a swankboat in local parlance. Those cobbled together out in the wilds are unlikely to be in such good condition. Once construction is complete, the builder must determine the vessel’s condition. This can be a single roll for the whole vessel or key components may be determined individually. 

To determine the condition of a craft, roll 2D on the Component Quality table as usual. DM-4 is applied if the vessel was put together in a makeshift construction frame and DM-8 if it was constructed more or less by hand in orbit or on a landing pad somewhere. No DM applies if the vessel was built in a typical Estuary Cluster facility, with a very basic but serviceable construction cradle and most of the proper tools. 

The builder may apply the highest Engineer skill involved in the build as a positive DM. A result of 12+ may cause the craft to somehow come out better than intended but it is more likely the vessel will be in rather poor condition. A vessel that falls out of the construction frame in Busted condition is intact, more or less, but will require further work to make it spaceworthy. 

It is in theory possible to just start putting bits together and hope the end result is a space vessel but more commonly there is some kind of design process. If the Travellers choose to build their own vessel they should work out ahead of time how much space is to be allocated to each function. Some empty space can be left for cargo or future upgrades, and a vessel can be made spaceworthy without being fully fitted out, but overall the Travellers should have an idea of what they are trying to build. 

## Buying (or Otherwise Obtaining) a Vessel 
Vessels change hands from time-to-time for all manner of reasons. Lost bets, ownership in lieu of a debt, retirement and all manner of other circumstances can result in someone becoming a vessel owner. Often a craft will be too decrepit for its current owners and will be sold for salvage or rebuilding by someone willing to put in the time and locate the parts. This is where most of the vessels for sale in the yards of the cluster come from; they are recycled from much older craft. 

The asking price for a vessel will be determined by its condition and any unusual circumstances.

For example, a small craft in Janky condition will have a base price of 65% its good-condition cost. The Referee can modify this upward if the craft has some components in better condition and downward if some are worse. Other circumstances that lower price include a bad reputation for killing its crews, connection with some nefarious individual, or a need for a quick sale. 

Not all sellers are trustworthy and everyone tries to make what they are selling look as valuable as possible. Potential buyers are well advised to have a good crawl-around in the less accessible parts of a craft, where its true condition is more likely to be apparent. Some degree of bargaining is possible and it pays to go in armed with a clear impression of the vessel’s condition. In some cases the buyer will back out upon seeing what is behind the access panels. 

There is no simple mortgage system in the Estuary Cluster for buying spacecraft and even if there was no bank would touch the majority of vessels operating there. How Travellers get the money together for a ship is their problem; most operators start out with something small and in poor condition, and hope to ‘work up’ the vessel in use. This leads to painful decisions whether to upgrade now or save money in the hope of getting something better. 

There are other ways to obtain a vessel. Salvage is always an option, although a craft that has been abandoned is unlikely to be in very good condition. Enterprising Travellers might even build a vessel from scratch. Loan craft are possible, perhaps in return for an agreement to patch up the vessel while they use it. Every vessel operating in the Estuary Cluster has its own unique ‘origin story’.

# Maintaining a Vessel 
For the lines and The Corp, vessel maintenance is a matter of booking a yard slot, paying the fee and enjoying a few days’ downtime while yard personnel perform their work. For everyone else, maintenance is more of a problem. There is no equivalent to the annual maintenance procedure followed by most ship operators. Instead, vessels are usually in a state of running repairs, with preventative maintenance something of a luxury. 

The overall quality level of the vessel determines whether it deteriorates in normal use and how quickly. A ship in Standard or Basic condition will not normally deteriorate in this manner unless annual maintenance is skipped. For ships in worse condition, deterioration is inevitable but the time frame varies. A deterioration check is made after a period of operation determined by overall condition.

## Deterioration Checks

| Ship Condition       | Deterioration Period                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Busted               | 1D days                                           |
| Crude                | 2D days                                           |
| Beyond Junky         | 4D days                                           |
| Janky                | 6D days                                           |
| Basic                | 2D x 5 days, but only after skipped maintainance  |
| Standard (or better) | 2D x 15 days, but only after skipped maintainance |



Each time a deterioration check is made, the period to the next is determined. The Referee can modify the period if there is some unusual factor at play such as frequent high-stress manoeuvres. 

After the deterioration period has passed, the ship operator must check to see if a system has deteriorated. The base chance of avoiding deterioration is 4+ on 2D, with the vessel’s overall quality providing a DM. This means that ships in poor condition can get worse very fast. The skill level of the best engineer aboard can be used as a positive DM, providing the crew are performing onboard maintenance and repair work. If the crew cannot be bothered or are distracted by something, the likelihood of a system getting worse is greater than that of a crew who are diligent. 

## System Deterioration

If deterioration occurs, the system affected is determined by making a 2D roll on the System Deterioration table. If the system is already Busted or is not present, roll again.

| 2D    | System Affected           |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Power Plant               |
| 4     | Specialist System         |
| 5     | Bridge and Control System |
| 6     | Accomodation              |
| 7     | Hull                      |
| 8     | Accomodation              |
| 9     | Jump Drive                |
| 10    | Specialist System         |
| 11-12 | Manoeuvre Drive           |

If a system is subdivided, such as aboard a ship that has a ‘luxury’ passenger stateroom, some ordinary passenger staterooms and a set of crew staterooms, determine randomly which is to be degraded. Subdivision must be logical rather than an attempt to spread out the deterioration process across redundant systems. 

It is not possible to stave off deterioration forever, other than by fixing a ship up to at least Basic condition and maintaining it properly. This is every Trucker’s dream but difficult to achieve in the limited economy of the Estuary Cluster.

## Power Issues 
A deteriorated power plant is one of the worst things that can happen to a space vessel. Most are constructed with only a small amount of excess power and a plant that is degraded will function at only a percentage of full output. One solution is to install a secondary power plant, giving extra capacity at the cost of internal space. Many boats in the cluster have a nonstandard power plant or backup for this reason. 

It may be possible to function at reduced power. A 1G rated drive running at a maximum of 0.5G uses only half the Power it would at full function. General systems’ power draw can also be reduced by turning off less important systems or running only what is required at any given time. A vessel putting less than the full Power requirement into its general systems will be uncomfortable and at times frustrating to operate but there are no serious effects until available Power drops below 75% of the normal requirement. Between 50–75% all actions to control the vessel or use its systems suffer DM-1 in addition to any other issues. Between 25% and 50%, this increases to DM-3. A vessel that has 10–25% Power available is a neardead hulk suffering DM-6 and should probably be abandoned as a hazard to navigation. Below 10% the vessel can do nothing but provide emergency life support to its crew and maybe power some tools as they desperately try to save their ship. 

For example, the Travellers have acquired a small craft whose power plant is Janky. Its usual output of Power 20 is reduced to 65% of that – 13 – but the craft needs Power 16 to run everything. 

The Travellers decide to limit their drive to 0.6G – it cannot manage much more than that anyway! – which causes it to draw only 60% of its usual requirement of Power 5. This saves two of the three needed Power. The other is gained by turning off some of the less essential general systems, reducing their draw from Power 10 to 8 but staying above the 75% threshold where real problems begin. The Travellers’ boat is slower and less comfortable than it could be with a properly working power plant but the situation has been stabilised for now. That contract they were offered; the one that seemed a bit sketchy? It is now beginning to look attractive. Power plant components are not cheap…
