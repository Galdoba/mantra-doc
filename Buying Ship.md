Spacecraft are eye-wateringly expensive to the extent that, ordinarily, only the very rich, governments or large corporations can afford them. However, an industry of ship mortgages has sprung up that allows individual Travellers at least the dream of owning their own ship, although the repayments can be suitably astronomical and may force them to make less than noble decisions in order to meet bills charged every four weeks (this is the basis and driving force of many Traveller campaigns).The monthly repayments on a ship mortgage are easy to calculate. Start with the total purchase price of the ship being bought, then divide this amount by 240. 

This is the amount that must be repaid every Maintenance Period for the next 40 years. 

## CAREER BENEFITS 
It is possible for some Travellers to receive a ship as a Benefit when leaving a career, such as a merchant receiving a free trader or a scholar receiving a laboratory ship. This represents them buying a ship earlier in life and a proportion of the mortgage will have already been paid off. 

Every time a ship is rolled as a Benefit, 25% of the original mortgage has been paid off. In practice, the Traveller may choose to continue to pay the calculated mortgage for 10 years less every time the Benefit is rolled (continuing the mortgage) and pay their ship off faster, or deduct 25% from the purchase price of the ship before calculating the mortgage cost (effectively re-mortgaging) to be paying less every four weeks. 

## SHIP SHARES 
Individual ship shares may also be earned during careers, each worth MCr1. If they are put towards the purchase of a ship, deduct MCr1 from the purchase cost of the ship for every share, then calculate the mortgage.

## OLDER SHIPS 
Many ships serve for decades or even centuries before being scrapped. Travellers and free traders are often forced by necessity to purchase outdated and damaged vessels instead of new and pristine ships. Travellers purchasing an outdated ship may do so by rolling on the Outdated Ships table. Older ships will have a number of ‘quirks’ that may affect their operation, rolled for on the Spacecraft Quirks table.

### Outdated ships
