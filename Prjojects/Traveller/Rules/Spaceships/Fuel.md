Fuel nominally costs Cr500 per ton of refined fuel and Cr100 for unrefined fuel. It is possible to obtain LSS and fuel at a lower cost if the Travellers have the right connections or can do a deal with someone. Each time the Travellers purchase fuel or LSS they can attempt to reduce the cost. This will typically be a Persuade check, although Broker may also apply. Each point of Effect on an Average (8+) check allows the cost to be reduced by 5%. Members of the Space Truckers’ Association gain DM+2 on this check in most ports.

Most ships use refined hydrogen as fuel for their fusion power plants engines and jump drives. Starports (see page 257) and virtually any other facility that regularly hosts spacecraft will offer refuelling facilities. Hydrogen is obtained from water or the atmospheres of gas giants and costs Cr500 per ton for refined fuel. Some out-of-the-way places only offer unrefined fuel, at the bargain price of just Cr100 per ton. Using unrefined fuel is dangerous when jumping (see [[Jump Travel]]). Either way, it typically takes 1D hours to refuel a typical ship.

A ship with fuel scoops may gather fuel from bodies of water using hoses. It may also scoop hydrogen from a [[Gas Giant Operations|gas giant]], requiring a Difficult (10+) Pilot check (1D hours, DEX). Fuel gathered in the wild is unrefined but a ship with fuel processors may refine it. More notes on fuel scooping are covered in the [Traveller Companion].
