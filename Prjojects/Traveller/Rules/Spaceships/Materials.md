# Production 
Materials can be produced by spaceship crew in necessary tools and components are available.

Once mining ship find asteroid it is considered [Mineral]. Ship's or station's [Mineral Refinery] can crush the ores and other by-products sorted, and waste released back into space. The produce is split between 50% Common Ore, 30% Uncommon Ore, 15% Crystals and Gems and 5% Precious Metals (as defined on page 244 of the Traveller Core Rulebook). For example, for every 100 tons of produce from the refinery, 50 tons is Basic Ore, 30 tons is Uncommon Ore, 15 tons
Crystals & Gems and five tons Precious Metals.

Ores are the normal end-product of a mineral refinery but many stations also conduct onboard processing to create more valuable materials. A [[smelter]] allows Common Ores to be processed into Common Raw Materials and Uncommon Ores into Uncommon Raw Materials. Each ton of smelter allows the processing of 0.2 tons of Ores into 0.1 tons of Raw
Materials per day. A smelter costs MCr0.5 and requires 1 Power per ton.

Raw Materials (common and uncommon) are used to produce [[Materials]] in production plant or [[workshop]] with folowwing ratio:

| Material Type | Production Input                                                                                     | Production Output |

# Materials 
Materials fall into three categories: Structural, Technical and Outfitting. Structural materials have a base cost of Cr10000 per unit. Technical materials cost Cr25000 per unit and Outfitting materials cost Cr1000 per unit. These are nominal costs and will vary depending on availability as well as other factors. The Travellers may be able to scavenge materials or loot them from an abandoned stash. 

| Material Type | Base Cost | Cargo Volume (per Unit) |
| ------------- | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| Structural    |  Cr10000  |        0.1 Tons         |
| Technical     |  Cr25000  |        0.01 Tons        |
| Outfitting    |  Cr1000   |        0.1 Tons         |


One unit of Structural or Outfitting material takes up 0.1 tons of cargo space and one unit of Technical material takes up 0.01 tons. This may be reduced by careful packing and arrangement but since materials are often chunks of salvage and have irregular shapes the amount of extra materials that can be crammed in is variable and largely dependent on how long the Travellers want to spend on completing the galaxy’s untidiest jigsaw. 

The material requirements to produce or upgrade different types of component depend on the nature of the system. The amount of materials per ton of the item is given on the Material Requirements table.
