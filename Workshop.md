A workshop can be used to repair parts and fabricate new ones and is a common feature on scouts and other ships that operate in the wilderness areas of space. 

Every six tons of space dedicated to workshops allows for two Travellers to use the Mechanic skill on board the ship with DM+2. 

Workshops cost MCr0.15 per ton.
