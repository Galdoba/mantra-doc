# From Core Rulebook
Most ships use refined hydrogen as fuel for their fusion power plants engines and jump drives. Starports (see page 257) and virtually any other facility that regularly hosts spacecraft will offer refuelling facilities. Hydrogen is obtained from water or the atmospheres of gas giants and costs Cr500 per ton for refined fuel. Some out-of-the-way places only offer unrefined fuel, at the bargain price of just Cr100 per ton. Using unrefined fuel is dangerous when jumping (see [[Jump Travel]]). 

It is possible to obtain fuel at a lower cost if the Travellers have the right connections or can do a deal with someone. Each time the Travellers purchase fuel they can attempt to reduce the cost. This will typically be a Persuade check, although Broker may also apply. Each point of Effect on an Average (8+) check allows the cost to be reduced by 5%. Members of the TAS gain DM+2 on this check in most ports.

A ship with [[Fuel Scoop|fuel scoops]] may gather fuel from bodies of water using hoses. It may also scoop hydrogen from a [[Gas Giant Operations|gas giant]], requiring a Difficult (10+) Pilot (1D hours, DEX) check. Fuel gathered in the wild is unrefined but a ship with [[Fuel Processor|fuel processors]] may refine it. More notes on fuel scooping are covered in the [Traveller Companion].

Fuel is a critical consideration for all starship operators, especially pirates. Their own fuel situation dictates whether they can reach a target and get away again, and of course the options available to prey are limited by fuel availability. Catching a target with dry tanks prevents it jumping to escape, and smart pirates know how many refuelling options are available in a system. This lets them predict where a sneaky trader or pirate hunter might obtain their fuel without making the predictable run to the starport. 

There is also the act of refuelling to consider. A ship caught on the ground with fuel hoses attached is vulnerable, so wise pirates take measures to secure their refuelling spots. The rate at which a starship can refuel itself depends on how much fuel tankage it has, since this also indicates fuel-handling capabilities. Each full 25 tons of fuel tankage counts as 1 Fuel Transfer Unit (FTU); ships with less than 25 tons of fuel tankage count as having 1 FTU. 

It is much quicker to hose up liquid water than to melt ice, especially since hoses usually have to be relocated several times during ice refuelling. Either way, water has to be cracked into hydrogen for fuel – this also generates oxygen for the life support system – and then refined if equipment is available. 

Gas giant refuelling rates depend on the ability of a pilot to optimise the skimming pass. Make an Average (8+) Pilot check with the ship’s Thrust rating as a DM. The Effect of this check is added to (or subtracted from) the refuelling rate. Thus a typical skimming operation yields (2D + Effect of Pilot check) tons of fuel per hour, per FTU.


| Method                          | Fuel per Hour                   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Starport Refuelling (Class A-C) | 50 tons per FTU                 | Standardised high-volume fuel transfer equipment is available at most good ports; refuelling a ship completely generally takes around 30 minutes.                                                   |
| Starport Refuelling (Class D)   | 25 tons per FTU                 | Less efficient fuel-handling equipment is typically in use at low-end ports, taking about an hour to refuel a vessel. Fuel is not usually available at Class E ports; ships must refuel themselves. |
| UNREP System                    | 20 tons per ton of UNREP system | The size of the UNREP system dictates how much can be transferred rather than the vessel’s own fuel handing system.                                                                                 |
| Gas Giant Skimming              | 2D tons per FTU, variable       | Typically around 7 tons of fuel per hour can be obtained by diving into a gas giant atmosphere and scooping up gases for processing. This can be increased by a skilled pilot.                      |
| Liquid Water                    | 3D3 tons per FTU                | Typically around 6 tons of fuel per hour can be obtained by cracking liquid water.                                                                                                                  |
| Ice Deposits                    | 1D tons per FTU                 | Typically 1-6 tons per hour can be obtained from a large ice deposit.                                                                                                                               |
| Sparse Ice Deposits             | D3 tons per FTU                 | Typically 1-3 tons per hour can be obtained if hoses have to be repeatedly moved to new deposits.                                                                                                   |

### Crossing the layers 
The layers of a gas giant’s atmosphere may expand and contract depending on local temperature conditions, causing the boundaries to move considerably. It is possible for a layer boundary to move rapidly up or down, causing it to impinge upon a starship maintaining a constant altitude. However, more commonly a ship will deliberately cross from one layer to another to avoid detection or reach a suitable altitude for fuel skimming. 

Crossing from one layer to another, up or down, requires an Average (8+) Pilot check with the largest negative DM for depth applied. Success indicates the ship has successfully crossed to the new layer without much more than some buffeting. In the event of failure, the ship fails to cross the layer and is bounced back with considerable violence. A second Pilot check, this one at Difficult (10+) difficulty and subject to the DM for the layer the ship is currently in, is required to avoid damage. If this check is failed, the ship suffers a number of dice in damage equal to the number of the layer it is trying to enter. So, a ship trying to enter the Deep layer and failing, suffers 4D Hull damage unless the pilot can succeed the second check. 

### Fuel skimming 
Fuel skimming takes a number of ‘passes’, during which the ship opens its scoops and forces gas into them by moving fast through the atmosphere – or by simply pointing into the wind. A ship can skim fuel equal to 1% of its hull tonnage per pass, with a pass typically requiring 2D minutes. Thus, a vessel wanting to obtain 20% of its hull tonnage in fuel in the Deep layer will need 20 passes averaging about seven minutes each, for a total of 140 minutes. Skimming would take twice as long in the Shallow layer but would also be safer.
