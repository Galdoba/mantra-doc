# Life Support
Life support and fuel are the main overheads for a junkboat crew. Each person living aboard a vessel incurs costs and requires a certain amount of supplies every day, including water, filters, air scrubbers and of course food. The basic requirement is one unit of Life Support Supplies (LSS) per person per day, or 1/10 of one unit for someone travelling in a low berth.

One unit of LSS costs Cr150 if bought singly and takes up 0.01 ton of space if carried as cargo. Vessels have an internal capacity for LSS equal to four times their displacement in tons. So, a 25-ton small craft can carry 100 units of LSS without using any cargo space, giving a duration of 50 days for a crew of two before replenishment is required. This will normally be at a port but underway replenishment is possible or further supplies carried in the cargo hold can be used. 

| LSS Parameter                     | Value       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Cost per 1 Unit                   | Cr150       |
| Consumtion (base) per person      | 1 per day   |
| Consumtion (Low birth) per person | 0.1 per day |
| Storage Ton of Hull               | 4 Units     |
| Storage per Ton of Cargo          | 100 Units   |
LSS can be considered a form of currency or might be shipped as cargo for someone else to use. They can also be traded between vessels at whatever price the market will stand. Life support costs come out at Cr1050 per person per week, assuming LSS is bought at retail prices. Smart Travellers will not pay these prices if they can help it. 

It is possible to eke out supplies by cutting rations and using items beyond safe limits. It will not seriously harm a crew to go on half rations for a couple of days, although they will be hungry and bad-tempered. Even when supplies run out, crew do not immediately stop functioning. However, increasingly foul air will impair their function until they die a slow death from suffocation. Every day after the supplies run out, each Traveller must make a Very Difficult (12+) END check, suffering damage equal to the negative Effect. 

LSS can be converted from SU in Biosphere Component. Ration is 3 SU to 2 LSS.
