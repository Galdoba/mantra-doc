Ores are the normal end-product of a mineral refinery but many stations also conduct onboard processing to create more valuable materials. A smelter allows Common Ores to be processed into Common Raw Materials and Uncommon Ores into Uncommon Raw Materials. Each ton of smelter allows the processing of 0.2 tons of Ores into 0.1 tons of Raw Materials per day. A smelter costs MCr0.5 and requires 1 Power per ton.

| Input Volume per day | Output Volume per day | Power |  Cost  |
| :------------------: | :-------------------: | :---: | :----: |
|       0.2 Tons       |       0.1 Tons        |   1   | MCr0.5 |
