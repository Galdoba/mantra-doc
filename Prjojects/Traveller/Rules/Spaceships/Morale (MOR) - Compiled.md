### **Analysis of Morale (MOR) Rules from Three Sources**

**Common Elements (All Three Sources):**
*   **Definition:** Morale (MOR) is a 0-15 characteristic representing the determination, psychological resilience, and overall mood of a group (ship's crew or military unit). It provides a Die Modifier (DM) for tasks related to group spirit and is much more volatile than CEI/ECEI.
*   **Morale Checks:** Two types exist, both resolved with a standard skill check (usually **Average (8+) Leadership or relevant social skill**):
    *   **Minor Morale Check:** Failure results in **MOR -1**.
    *   **Major Morale Check:** Failure results in **MOR -1D**.
    *   If unspecified, a check is assumed to be Minor.
*   **Leadership Crisis Trigger:** A Leadership Crisis occurs under two conditions: 1) **MOR drops by 3 or more points from a single event**, or 2) **A key leader (captain, executive officer, department/division head) is incapacitated/killed without a clear and present replacement**.
*   **Core Events Affecting Morale:** All sources list overlapping categories of events that necessitate a Morale check (type determined by severity):
    *   **Deliberate Action:** Conscious efforts to influence morale (positive or negative).
    *   **Hardship:** Enduring poor conditions (cramped quarters, bad rations, hostile environment) for an extended period.
    *   **Injustice:** Perceived unfair or overly harsh treatment/punishment.
    *   **Lack of Liberty/Recreation:** Being denied expected downtime, leave, or "shore leave."
    *   **Severe Danger:** Being ordered into disproportionately hazardous situations, especially if the necessity is unclear.
    *   **Success:** Achieving a clear, worthwhile, and difficult goal can **increase MOR by +1 (or more)**.
    *   **Weak Leadership:** Witnessing challenges to authority or displays of officer incompetence.

**Key Differences & Source-Specific Details:**

1.  **Naval Sourcebook:**
    *   **Scope:** Standard rules for naval and civilian vessels.
    *   **Starting Morale:** Provides a table for different ship types (see table below).
    *   **Leadership Crisis:** States a crisis "may cause ECEI to be reduced." No specific resolution mechanic is provided beyond this.

2.  **Deepnight Revelation Campaign:**
    *   **Scope:** Specific to the Deepnight Revelation campaign ship, with notes for encountered vessels.
    *   **Starting Morale:** The Deepnight's crew starts at **CEI + 2D3** (higher due to volunteer status). For other vessels, it uses the Naval Sourcebook table.
    *   **Leadership Crisis:** Provides a **detailed resolution mechanic**. A character can attempt to avert the crisis with an **Average (8+) Leadership, Persuade, or Diplomat check**. Failure reduces the ship's **CEI Modifier (CEIM)** by the negative Effect and permanently reduces base **CEI by -1**.

3.  **Mercenary Book:**
    *   **Scope:** Rules for military and paramilitary forces.
    *   **Starting Morale:** Provides a table for different force types, analogous to the naval table (see table below).
    *   **Leadership Crisis:** Similar to the Naval book, states it "may cause ECEI to be reduced."
    *   **Enhanced Events:** Expands on some event categories with more military-focused details and examples (e.g., "Recreation, Leave and Furlough" as a formal category, detailed examples for "Severely Hazardous Assignments").

### **Compiled Rules for Morale (MOR)**

**1. Definition and Scale**
Morale (MOR) is a characteristic rated from 0 to 15 that measures the spirit, cohesion, and willingness to endure hardship of a group—be it a ship's crew or a military unit. It functions as a Die Modifier (DM) for checks involving the group's collective will, such as resisting panic or enduring a grueling march. MOR is far more fluid than other effectiveness indices and can change rapidly due to events.

**2. Determining Starting Morale**
A group's starting MOR is based on its type and base effectiveness (CEI). Roll the indicated dice and add the result to the group's CEI.

*   **For Ships & Spacecraft (Naval & Deepnight Sources):**

| Vessel Type                            | Starting MOR Formula |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Naval Warship                          | CEI + 1D             |
| Naval Auxiliary / Merchant Line Vessel | CEI + D3             |
| Paramilitary Vessel or Corsair         | CEI + 1D             |
| Independent Vessel (e.g., Free Trader) | CEI + 0              |
| *Deepnight Revelation (Specific)*      | **CEI + 2D3**        |

*   **For Military & Paramilitary Forces (Mercenary Source):**

| Force Type | Starting MOR Formula |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fully Trained Professional Force | CEI + 1D |
| Recently Raised / Reserve Force / Motivated Militia | CEI + D3 |
| Angry Mob | CEI + 1D |
| Armed Civilians | CEI + 0 |

*(The Referee may apply a discretionary modifier of up to ±3 to reflect recent history or special circumstances.)*

**3. Morale Checks**
When an event tests the group's spirit, a Morale Check is required.
*   **Difficulty:** Typically **Average (8+)**, but may be adjusted by the Referee.
*   **Skill:** Usually **Leadership**, but **Persuade, Diplomat**, or another appropriate social skill may be used depending on the approach.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   **Minor Morale Check:** Failure reduces **MOR by 1**.
    *   **Major Morale Check:** Failure reduces **MOR by 1D**.
    *   If the type of check is not specified, assume it is **Minor**.

**4. Leadership Crisis**
A Leadership Crisis is a severe breakdown of confidence in command.

*   **Trigger:** A crisis occurs if 1) **MOR drops by 3 or more points from a single event**, OR 2) **A key leader (commanding officer, executive officer, department/division head) is incapacitated or killed without a clear and immediate replacement**.

*   **Resolution - Contradictory Methods:**
    *   **Method A (Naval & Mercenary Source):** The crisis may cause a reduction in the group's **Effective CEI (ECEI)**. The exact amount is at the Referee's discretion.
    *   **Method B (Deepnight Source):** A character can attempt to avert the crisis through decisive action (e.g., an inspiring speech, presenting a workaround). This requires an **Average (8+) Leadership, Persuade, or Diplomat check**. **Failure** reduces the group's **current effectiveness modifier (CEIM for ships, or an equivalent for other groups) by the negative Effect** and **permanently reduces the base CEI by 1**.

**5. Events Affecting Morale**
The following events typically require a Morale Check. The Referee determines if it is Minor or Major based on the severity.

*   **Deliberate Action:** Organized efforts to boost (or undermine) morale, such as a commander's speech or a disgruntled crewman's rabble-rousing. This requires sustained effort (days) and a relevant skill check. Success can raise MOR by +1.
*   **Hardship:** Enduring sustained poor conditions—short rations, extreme overcrowding, or operating in a hostile environment without proper gear—for an extended period (e.g., every 2D days/weeks).
*   **Injustice:** The group perceives unfairness, such as disproportionate punishment, favoritism, or arbitrary rules.
*   **Lack of Liberty/Recreation:** Being denied expected periods of rest, "shore leave," or furlough. Personnel understand operational security but will chafe under prolonged lockdown without respite.
*   **Severe Danger:** Being ordered into a situation of extreme, seemingly gratuitous risk. The check is less severe (Minor) if the tactical necessity is clear and compelling to the group.
*   **Success:** Achieving a significant, difficult, and non-routine goal. A successful follow-up **Leadership check** can increase **MOR by +1** (or more for extraordinary success).
*   **Weak Leadership:** Witnessing a direct challenge to authority, a public display of incompetence, or a loss of face by the command staff.
