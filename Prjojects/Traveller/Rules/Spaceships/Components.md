## Component Grades

The components described in High Guard are the industry standard in much of Charted Space and constructed in a manner enabling them to be used ‘off the shelf’ in many craft. 

On most worlds of the cluster, TL8 is the best that is readily available. There are, however, a few facilities that manufacture TL9 items for spacecraft and installations. It is possible to create facsimiles of TL10–11 equipment using these, although prototypes created in this manner are subject to disadvantages as shown on page 70 of High Guard. 

One important result of this is that ships will not conform to quantised standards in force elsewhere. Some vessels will have thrust ratings measured in decimals and will need to list their thrust potential as well as their current thrust capability. For example, a craft may have been built with a drive capable of 1G thrust but years of hard use have reduced its capability to 0.4G. A device can be brought back up to its original potential by replacing parts but cannot be increased past 1G. 

This requires a decision for spacers. Should they spend time and money on augmenting their ship’s rather feeble thrust back to a level closer to its original potential, or should they save up for a replacement drive with a higher potential? They may be able to buy a drive originally capable of 1.6G cheaply if it has degraded to a significant degree, with the intention of tinkering it to full potential later. 

It is unlikely that the Travellers will be able to buy shipyard-grade components but if they can do so then they can fit standard ship elements such as staterooms and common areas ‘straight out of the book’. More commonly they will need to construct something similar in function out of whatever components are available. The quality of components – which reflects how easy or comfortable they are to use, how they look and how much they will impress or annoy visitors – is rated on the following scale: 

**Busted:** A component in Busted condition does not work at all and is likely only to be useful as a source of spares. It is not possible to construct components in Busted condition – at least, not deliberately – but Busted components can be upgraded to a better condition at double the usual cost in materials. 

**Crude:** The component is a godawful mess of mismatched parts and pieces, and overall is barely functional. Machinery will be highly unreliable, awkward to use and ugly to look at. Bits sticking out in awkward places create trip hazards and opportunities for selfinjury. If enough parts are replaced by something better, it will be possible to elevate the item to Beyond Janky status. Performance will likely be about 10–20% of what a standard component can do, with DM-4 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Beyond Janky:** The component is more than likely on its last legs and does not function very well at all. It can be improved to Janky status by replacing sufficient parts with better items. Performance will likely be about 30–50% of what a standard item can deliver, with DM-3 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Janky:** Janky items are to some extent an industry standard in the cluster. They are ugly, awkward to use and prone to breakdowns. As always, upgrades are possible if the right components are available. Performance is likely to be 60–70% of standard, with DM-2 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Basic:** Basic items are nearly as good as standard, although they lack comfort, ease of use and special features. Performance is likely to be 80–90% of standard, with DM-1 imposed on checks involving the component. 

**Standard:** Standard items are as good as what a shipyard would install. 

**Improved:** Improved items are typically as much as 25% better than shipyard-installed items or allow DM+1 to be applied. They are rarely seen in the cluster, although some rich individuals may have created vessels for their personal use which more resemble flying palaces.

**High-Quality:** High-quality items are up to 50% more effective than an equivalent standard component or allow DM+2 to be applied. They are very rare. 

Components will either provide a DM to actions involving their use or operate at a reduced or (rarely) enhanced level. DMs apply to all relevant actions and common sense applies in all cases. 

For example, high-quality cargo space cannot fit more cargo than the same displacement of common old cargo space but if there is cargo handling equipment available it will operate faster and more efficiently. Janky cargo space probably has awkward projections and malfunctioning equipment, imposing a DM on cargo handling operations rather than reducing the amount of cargo that can be hauled – although that is a possibility if some parts of the cargo bay are unusable. 

When a component is to be produced, the amount of materials required to put it together must be determined. Until all these materials are added the component is unfinished and will not be functional. Once completed, the constructor will need to determine its condition. It is possible to spend months putting a power plant together from scavenged parts, only to find it barely functions. All required materials are used up even if the item is not of an acceptable level of functionality at the end of the process. 

The amount of materials required to upgrade a component depends upon its current condition. Upgrading a Busted item to a Crude and minimally functional state requires vastly less materials than improving a Basic one to Standard condition. Upgrading can only be done one level at a time. It might be cheaper in the long run to replace a component than to keep pulling the system apart and making small changes. However, new components are hard to come by.

If it is necessary to determine the quality of a component, for example when salvaging a wreck, a 2D check is made. If the check comes up a straight 12, roll again. On 11+ the component is somehow in a High-Quality state; otherwise it is in an Improved state. 

For example, a Busted component requires only a tenth of the materials to upgrade to Crude status as it would to go from Basic to Standard condition.

## Component Types
Components fall into the following categories: Structural, Utility, Control, Machinery and Drives. Each requires different types of materials in differing proportions to construct or upgrade. 

### Structural 
Structural components include the hull and internal bulkheads. They require only Structural materials. 

### Utility 
Utility components include staterooms and common areas, and other internal systems such as cargo handling cranes, briefing rooms, small craft grapples and other systems. Utility components need structural components but only a trivial amount of electronics. 

### Control 
Control systems are electronics-heavy, requiring a considerable amount of technical components in addition to some structural and outfitting supplies. Control systems include computers, the bridge and also weapons aboard ships that have them.

### Machinery 
Machinery includes all systems that require considerable amounts of electronics as well as structural components. These include power systems and heavy internal machinery such as cargo handling cranes. 

### Drives 
Drives include all types of manoeuvre drive and the jump drive. They are expensive items to maintain and upgrade due to their requirement for a great deal of technical materials.
