For the lines and The Corp, vessel maintenance is a matter of booking a yard slot, paying the fee and enjoying a few days’ downtime while yard personnel perform their work. For everyone else, maintenance is more of a problem. There is no equivalent to the annual maintenance procedure followed by most ship operators. Instead, vessels are usually in a state of running repairs, with preventative maintenance something of a luxury. 

The overall quality level of the vessel determines whether it deteriorates in normal use and how quickly. A ship in Standard or Basic condition will not normally deteriorate in this manner unless annual maintenance is skipped. For ships in worse condition, deterioration is inevitable but the time frame varies. A deterioration check is made after a period of operation determined by overall condition.

## Deterioration Checks

| Ship Condition       | Deterioration Period                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Busted               | 1D days                                           |
| Crude                | 2D days                                           |
| Beyond Junky         | 4D days                                           |
| Janky                | 6D days                                           |
| Basic                | 2D x 5 days, but only after skipped maintainance  |
| Standard (or better) | 2D x 15 days, but only after skipped maintainance |



Each time a deterioration check is made, the period to the next is determined. The Referee can modify the period if there is some unusual factor at play such as frequent high-stress manoeuvres. 

After the deterioration period has passed, the ship operator must check to see if a system has deteriorated. The base chance of avoiding deterioration is 4+ on 2D, with the vessel’s overall quality providing a DM. This means that ships in poor condition can get worse very fast. The skill level of the best engineer aboard can be used as a positive DM, providing the crew are performing onboard maintenance and repair work. If the crew cannot be bothered or are distracted by something, the likelihood of a system getting worse is greater than that of a crew who are diligent. 

## System Deterioration

If deterioration occurs, the system affected is determined by making a 2D roll on the System Deterioration table. If the system is already Busted or is not present, roll again.

| 2D    | System Affected           |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Power Plant               |
| 4     | Specialist System         |
| 5     | Bridge and Control System |
| 6     | Accomodation              |
| 7     | Hull                      |
| 8     | Accomodation              |
| 9     | Jump Drive                |
| 10    | Specialist System         |
| 11-12 | Manoeuvre Drive           |

If a system is subdivided, such as aboard a ship that has a ‘luxury’ passenger stateroom, some ordinary passenger staterooms and a set of crew staterooms, determine randomly which is to be degraded. Subdivision must be logical rather than an attempt to spread out the deterioration process across redundant systems. 

It is not possible to stave off deterioration forever, other than by fixing a ship up to at least Basic condition and maintaining it properly. This is every Trucker’s dream but difficult to achieve in the limited economy of the Estuary Cluster.

## Power Issues 
A deteriorated power plant is one of the worst things that can happen to a space vessel. Most are constructed with only a small amount of excess power and a plant that is degraded will function at only a percentage of full output. One solution is to install a secondary power plant, giving extra capacity at the cost of internal space. Many boats in the cluster have a nonstandard power plant or backup for this reason. 

It may be possible to function at reduced power. A 1G rated drive running at a maximum of 0.5G uses only half the Power it would at full function. General systems’ power draw can also be reduced by turning off less important systems or running only what is required at any given time. A vessel putting less than the full Power requirement into its general systems will be uncomfortable and at times frustrating to operate but there are no serious effects until available Power drops below 75% of the normal requirement. Between 50–75% all actions to control the vessel or use its systems suffer DM-1 in addition to any other issues. Between 25% and 50%, this increases to DM-3. A vessel that has 10–25% Power available is a neardead hulk suffering DM-6 and should probably be abandoned as a hazard to navigation. Below 10% the vessel can do nothing but provide emergency life support to its crew and maybe power some tools as they desperately try to save their ship. 

For example, the Travellers have acquired a small craft whose power plant is Janky. Its usual output of Power 20 is reduced to 65% of that – 13 – but the craft needs Power 16 to run everything. 

The Travellers decide to limit their drive to 0.6G – it cannot manage much more than that anyway! – which causes it to draw only 60% of its usual requirement of Power 5. This saves two of the three needed Power. The other is gained by turning off some of the less essential general systems, reducing their draw from Power 10 to 8 but staying above the 75% threshold where real problems begin. The Travellers’ boat is slower and less comfortable than it could be with a properly working power plant but the situation has been stabilised for now. That contract they were offered; the one that seemed a bit sketchy? It is now beginning to look attractive. Power plant components are not cheap…
