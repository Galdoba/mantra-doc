# Annual Overhaul

Annually, a starship should be given a complete overhaul in order to insure that it is kept in good working order. Such maintenance costs 0.1% (1/1000th) of the cash price of the ship, and requires two weeks at a class A or B starport. The owner must make provision for payment of the maintenance fee when it comes due. Crew members generally take their vacation at this time, but must still be paid. Provision should also be made for the expected loss of revenue while the ship is out of service.

If starport facilities are not available, full overhaul will take 2D+12 days instead and absorbs the
attention of almost the entire crew.

Cost for SU:
An overhaul requires (4D x 5 x Daily Consumption rounded up) [[Supply Unit (SU)|Supply Units (SU)]]. This can be reduced by a successful Difficult (10+) Admin check, with SU consumption reduced by 5% per point of Effect. A negative Effect increases consumption by 5% per point.

Examples:
Free Trader (Type: A) daily consumption is 2 SU, Average cost of overhaul well be 4D x 5 x 2 (140 SU, or 40-240 SU)
Mercenary Cruiser (Type: C) consumes 9 SU. Average cost will be 630 SU.

# Maintanance Period
Maintainance period is 28 days. After it expires GM makes Average (8+) ECEI Check adding modifiers to the effect:
- (14 - Number of mantainance periods completed after last Overhaul) first 13 Maintainance Periods give positive DM
- Supply situation (see table)

If check is passed - no negative effects are happening
If check if failed: 
- Variant A: defects determination roll.
- Variant B: start component [[Vessel Deterioration|deterioration]] mechanics
