# Summary
There are 2 types of fuel:

| Fuel      | Base Cost | DMs on J-Drive usage |
| --------- | :-------: | :------------------: |
| Unrefined |   Cr100   |          -2          |
| Refined   |   Cr500   |          +0          |
Unrefined fuel can be converted to Refined by [[Fuel Processor]].

The rate at which a starship can refuel itself depends on how much fuel tankage it has, since this also indicates fuel-handling capabilities. Each full 25 tons of fuel tankage counts as 1 Fuel Transfer Unit (FTU); ships with less than 25 tons of fuel tankage count as having 1 FTU. 

## Civil refueling
Buying Fuel is subject to bargain with Broker or Persuate Average (8+) check. Each effect point moves price by 5%.
**Optional:** Consider to incorporate factors influencing actual fuel cost.
- [World Bridge Factor]
- Presence of Gas Giants in a system
- Presence of Ice or/and Liquid Water on the world.

## Wild refueling
### Planet surface
A ship caught on the ground with fuel hoses attached is vulnerable, so wise pirates take measures to secure their refuelling spots. Most worlds ban Wild refueling on planet surface.

It is much quicker to hose up liquid water than to melt ice, especially since hoses usually have to be relocated several times during ice refuelling. Either way, water has to be cracked into hydrogen for fuel – this also generates oxygen for the life support system – and then refined if equipment is available. 

### Gas Giant
Gas giant refuelling rates depend on the ability of a pilot to optimise the skimming pass. Make an Average (8+) Pilot check with the ship’s Thrust rating as a DM. The Effect of this check is added to (or subtracted from) the refuelling rate. Thus a typical skimming operation yields (2D + Effect of Pilot check) tons of fuel per hour, per FTU. 

Pass is a subject for Gas Giant layers mechanics. Entering and leaving Gas Giant atmosphere is described at [[Gas Giant Operations]]. Collected fuel is **unrefined** quality. [[Fuel Scoop]] is required to collect fuel from Gas Giant.

| Method                          | Fuel per Hour                   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starport Refuelling (Class A-C) | 50 tons per FTU                 | Standardised high-volume fuel transfer equipment is available at most good ports; refuelling a ship completely generally takes around 30 minutes.                                                   |
| Starport Refuelling (Class D)   | 25 tons per FTU                 | Less efficient fuel-handling equipment is typically in use at low-end ports, taking about an hour to refuel a vessel. Fuel is not usually available at Class E ports; ships must refuel themselves. |
| UNREP System                    | 20 tons per ton of UNREP system | The size of the UNREP system dictates how much can be transferred rather than the vessel’s own fuel handing system.                                                                                 |
| Gas Giant Skimming              | 2D tons per FTU, variable       | Typically around 7 tons of fuel per hour can be obtained by diving into a gas giant atmosphere and scooping up gases for processing. This can be increased by a skilled pilot.                      |
| Liquid Water                    | 3D3 tons per FTU                | Typically around 6 tons of fuel per hour can be obtained by cracking liquid water.                                                                                                                  |
| Ice Deposits                    | 1D tons per FTU                 | Typically 1-6 tons per hour can be obtained from a large ice deposit.                                                                                                                               |
| Sparse Ice Deposits             | D3 tons per FTU                 | Typically 1-3 tons per hour can be obtained if hoses have to be repeatedly moved to new deposits.                                                                                                   |
