Skimming fuel from a gas giant is a common practice, requiring a rapid transit through the upper atmosphere to force gases into a scoop. These are then processed to extract hydrogen which is compressed until sufficient liquid hydrogen is available for use as fuel. Skimming is a common means of refuelling a fleet before advancing to attack a target world – going into action with dry tanks means the fleet cannot escape by jumping away from a bad situation. 

Not surprisingly, many powers seek to deny the enemy this capability, and on a smaller scale patrol vessels are often stationed at a gas giant to catch pirates or other criminals trying to avoid the starports. This can result in a dangerous game of cat-andmouse in a gas giant’s atmosphere. 

### Gas giant layers

A gas giant’s atmosphere can be considered to consist of layers of increasing density. These are usually separated by temperature inversions which can interfere with the operation of a ship’s sensors. The deeper layers of a gas giant’s atmosphere are inaccessible to starships as the pressure and turbulence encountered there would destroy any known ship. However, the upper layers can be used for skimming or to conceal a ship. 

As a general rule, the deeper in the atmosphere a ship goes, the harder it is to detect and the faster it can fill its tanks with liquid hydrogen. However, turbulence is greater at these depths, imposing difficulties in controlling the ship. 

1. **Wisp:** The outer layer of a gas giant’s atmosphere is too thin to skim for fuel or fully conceal a ship but does impose some drag on a vessel or object in orbit. Powered course corrections from time-to-time will be necessary to prevent an orbit from decaying, although this is likely to take days or even weeks to become a serious problem. A ship that loses power in the Wisp zone has plenty of time to repair its systems. 

2. **Extreme Shallow:** The upper layers of the atmosphere are not subject to much turbulence. It is possible to skim fuel in the extreme shallows but it will take 10 times as long as in the Deep zone. Power loss will result in orbital decay in 8D hours. There are no serious turbulence effects at this level and no penalty to Pilot checks. 

3. **Shallow:** The Shallows are reasonably safe to operate in and allow skimming for fuel at half the normal rate. Orbital decay will occur in 2D hours if power is lost. All Pilot checks are made with DM-1 in the Shallows. 

4. **Deep:** Fuel skimming and commercial exploitation such as petrochemical harvesting is normally done in the Deep zone. Skimming is at the normal rate and conditions tend to be sufficiently turbulent that Pilot checks are made with at DM-2. A vessel that loses power in the Deeps will start to fall immediately, hitting the top of the Extreme Deep layer in 2D minutes. 

5. **Extreme Deep:** Few vessels venture into the Extreme Deeps other than specially built research craft and warships optimised for hiding in a gas giant’s atmosphere. Turbulent conditions impose DM-3 on all Pilot checks. A vessel without power in the Extreme Deeps will be tossed about by incredible winds, suffering 2D damage every round. It will fall to the top of the Depths in 2D minutes. 

6. **Depths:** Very few vessels have returned from the Depths of any gas giant world. Any ship at this depth, other than those specially constructed to survive there, suffers 2D damage each round, increasing to 6D if the ship is unstable due to power loss. A vessel will enter the Abyssal Depths in 2D minutes if falling without power. All Pilot checks are made at DM-4 in the Depths.

7. **Abyssal Depths:** The technology required to build a ship capable of operating in the Abyssal Depths is beyond most starfaring species. The incredible pressures and turbulence inflict 4D damage per round on any vessel venturing there. The pressure is so great at this depth that pools of liquid hydrogen can be encountered near the bottom. Some gas giants have a rocky or metallic core; others simply a high-pressure world-ocean of hydrogen. A ship that hits the bottom of a gas giant’s atmosphere will be destroyed quickly. All Pilot checks are made at DM-5 in the Abyssal depths and sensor systems will not function. 

###### Additional factors
All gas giants have a turbulent atmosphere. One that is unusually active will impose an additional DM-2 on all Pilot checks made in the atmosphere. Particularly violent giants impose DM-4. These worlds are rarely skimmed for fuel, except by the most desperate of crews. 

### Crossing the layers 
The layers of a gas giant’s atmosphere may expand and contract depending on local temperature conditions, causing the boundaries to move considerably. It is possible for a layer boundary to move rapidly up or down, causing it to impinge upon a starship maintaining a constant altitude. However, more commonly a ship will deliberately cross from one layer to another to avoid detection or reach a suitable altitude for fuel skimming. 

Crossing from one layer to another, up or down, requires an Average (8+) Pilot check *(Drinax Companion: ship’s Thrust rating as a DM)* with the largest negative DM for depth applied. Success indicates the ship has successfully crossed to the new layer without much more than some buffeting. In the event of failure, the ship fails to cross the layer and is bounced back with considerable violence. A second Pilot check, this one at Difficult (10+) difficulty and subject to the DM for the layer the ship is currently in, is required to avoid damage. If this check is failed, the ship suffers a number of dice in damage equal to the number of the layer it is trying to enter. So, a ship trying to enter the Deep layer and failing, suffers 4D Hull damage unless the pilot can succeed the second check. 

### Fuel skimming 
Fuel skimming takes a number of ‘passes’, during which the ship opens its scoops and forces gas into them by moving fast through the atmosphere – or by simply pointing into the wind. A ship can skim fuel equal to 1% of its hull tonnage per pass, with a pass typically requiring 2D minutes. Thus, a vessel wanting to obtain 20% of its hull tonnage in fuel in the Deep layer will need 20 passes averaging about seven minutes each, for a total of 140 minutes. Skimming would take twice as long in the Shallow layer but would also be safer. 

### Sensors and Combat
Sensors and beam weapons are attenuated in the thick atmosphere of a gas giant. All checks to detect another vessel are subject to DM-2 for each layer the ships are apart. Thus, a system defence boat patrolling the Wisp layer suffers DM-4 to spot a pirate ship hiding from it in the Shallow layer. It is common to seed sensor drones in gas giant atmospheres to offset this problem. Drones are very short-lived in the Deep zone, so tend to be positioned in the higher areas. Ships with access to drones can be considered to be sensing from the Wisp, Extreme Shallows or Shallow areas; whichever is most beneficial. A ship outside the Wisp zone, with no access to sensor drones, would suffer DM-2 for each layer down the target was hiding. 

Energy-based weapon ranges are halved for every layer the firing ship is down and each dice of damage is reduced by one point per layer the ship is down. Thus, a vessel firing a pulse laser in the Deep zone does only 2D-8 damage if it hits. 

Missiles and torpedoes do full damage in a gas giant atmosphere but may be destroyed if they cross between layers. Weapons designed for use in these conditions (e.g. torpedoes used in mines seeded in an atmosphere) can safely cross between layers on a straight Routine (6+) check. For standard missiles and torpedoes, this is an Average (8+) check. However, this does not apply when shooting into the Wisp, Extreme Shallows, or Shallow layers; ships in these areas can be attacked normally by missiles fired from outside the atmosphere, making the positioning of other vessels in a high guard position extremely important.
