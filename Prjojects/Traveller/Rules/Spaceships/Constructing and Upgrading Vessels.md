When a vessel is created its baseline Tech Level needs to be assigned. Even if the vessel contains a number of more advanced items its baseline TL remains the same. Upgrading a vessel to a higher Tech Level is a huge undertaking requiring a major rebuild. If this were to be done for some reason, the vessel’s new baseline Tech Level would be defined by the lowest of its hull, bridge and power plant Tech Level. 

It may also be possible to salvage more or less complete components from a wreck. These might be in poor condition but even an item that is in Beyond Janky provides a base upon which to build later. Brave Travellers might decide to install an unreliable, busted-up old jump drive and hope to survive long enough to fix it up. 

A complete [[Components|component]], say a TL14 jump drive, can be installed in a ‘black box’ configuration providing suitable interface devices can be constructed. Installing a complete component requires an **Average (8+) Engineer check (INT)** with a negative **DM equal to the difference between the component’s Tech Level and that of the vessel** it is to be installed into. Failing this check reduces the condition of the component by one level, but does not preclude a future attempt. 

The costs given in *High Guard* represent what it costs to have a shipyard install that component in your ship. A component can instead be cobbled together from available parts. The maximum TL of components created this way is two TL above what is available locally. Trying to put together TL11-equivalent systems using TL9 components is quite a challenge. As per page 70 of High Guard, a component one Tech Level above local (TL10) will cost 500% of normal price and have one disadvantage. Two Tech Levels above local (TL11) costs 1,000% of normal price and imposes two disadvantages. It is highly unlikely any local yard will have items of this sort for sale but cost increases also apply to constructing and upgrading components. These increases are applied to the amount of components required when upgrading or constructing higher-tech items. For example, creating a TL10 component from what is available in the Estuary Cluster requires five times as many materials. 

It may be that the Travellers will decide the project is impractical when they find out how many materials they are going to need. They cannot simply roll again straight away but if a new source of materials becomes available there may be something within that bridges one of the project’s gaps. In this case the Referee should allow the project’s material cost to be redetermined. 

For example, a standard 20-ton starship bridge for a 300 ton vessel would cost MCr1.5 to buy new. The Travellers want to construct one from what they can find lying around. They need 2D units of Structural materials, 3D units of Technical materials and 2D units of Outfitting materials per ton of the bridge. Rolling the dice they discover they will need 2 Structural at a cost of Cr10000 per unit, 9 Technical at Cr25000 per unit and 8 Outfitting at Cr1000 per unit. 

The materials cost is Cr253000 per ton, or MCr4.9. This is vastly more than just buying a new bridge and having it installed but if the Travellers have no choice but to build a starship’s control centre from scratch they will get through a lot of materials. They decide this is too expensive and hold off construction for a while. If they can find a new source of materials the Referee may allow them to reroll the amount of, say, Technical parts needed, reflecting the possibility of finding a magnetohydrodynamic torsion controller in working condition and not having to cobble one together out of hundreds of domestic appliances. 

Construction costs can be offset by finding a cheaper source of components, or getting them free. Salvage might yield complete components – which are unlikely to be in good condition – or parts that can be broken down for use elsewhere. It may be possible to obtain components as a reward for completing missions, or to steal them from rivals if the Travellers are that way inclined. 

Once the Travellers have enough of the requisite materials they can attempt to put the component together. This can be done singly or as a group. 

For example, the Travellers might construct a living quarters module consisting of four staterooms and an eight-ton common area. They can be inventive in their description of what they are installing so long as it is plausible. Perhaps they might decide the common area contains the galaxy’s smallest galley, a tiny eating area and a grand piano.

Putting the component together requires a Difficult (10+) Engineer check (INT) with a negative DM equal to the difference in Tech Level of the component and the vessel’s baseline Tech Level. Effect -6 or worse means the Travellers have botched the construction and must start again, losing 2D-2x10% of their materials in the process. Any other result produces a finished component… of sorts. 

The starting condition of the component is determined by a 2D roll on the Component Quality table (see page 35), with a DM equal to the Effect of the Engineer check made to construct it. Only on a straight 12 will the item somehow come out better than intended. A result other than a straight 12, modified to 12+, is treated as 11. 

For example, the Travellers decide to put together the accommodation complex mentioned before. The four staterooms come to 16 tons in total. The common area is eight tons. The material requirement for this complex is 3D Structural and 5D Outfitting materials per ton. The Travellers find they need 11 Structural and 24 Outfitting materials per ton. That comes out at MCr3.216 in materials. Compared to the shipyard cost of MCr2.8 this is not a great deal for a component that might not be in good condition but there are no alternatives. 

The Travellers make their check to see if their component is any good. Their highest Engineer skill gives them DM+2 on their check but the dice are unkind and come up a 5. With DM+2 this is 7, well below the required 10 for the Difficult (10+) Engineer check. They have managed to put together a living area but… yikes! The component quality check is made with DM-3. A roll of 10 looks promising but reduced to 7 this indicates the component the Travellers have built is Janky. It imposes DM-2 on checks to use its facilities and prospective passengers are unlikely to react favourably to it. 

The accommodation complex takes up the same displacement as a standard set of staterooms and common area but has less useable space, mismatched upholstery and freshers that only work when they feel like it. This accommodation block is sufficient to be used by hardy souls but will disappoint most passengers and disgust many. Perhaps it can be upgraded later.

## Work Time and Facility Requirements 
The time required to carry out work is measured in shifts. A shift assumes a competent(ish) person working a normal part of the day, so will be 6–10 hours. Travellers can put in double shifts for a while but eventually fatigue and boredom will set in. The Referee might allow the Travellers to work round the clock in a desperate situation but it is unrealistic to claim that even the most dedicated of crews can work 16-hour days for months on end. 

More commonly a project will proceed at a steady pace, sustainable without an increased risk of accidents or substandard results. Shifts can be staggered so that work is constantly ongoing. How quickly the project proceeds depends on facilities available. 

The hardest way to build or modify craft is to do it while the vessel is in flight, yet this is surprisingly common within the Estuary Cluster. Many vessels proceed about their business with some of their systems dismantled for repair or tinkering with. Even in a parking orbit, work can be extremely difficult without specialist equipment for handling heavy components. 

In this or during other crew-only work, producing or upgrading one ton of components will require 4D+4 shifts, or about three weeks of work for a single person. This assumes that components are available in a form where they can be fitted together rather than having to be constructed from scratch. Ideally, the Travellers will have someone preparing components and getting them to the construction team. Otherwise they will have to take time away from the project to machine and assemble the parts they need. 

A basic construction rig will greatly shorten the process. A basic rig will normally include robots or waldos for handling large components and some kind of framework to assist the assembly process. A salvage rig can also be used for construction. Using a basic construction rig or the equivalent reduces the number of shifts required to 3D+3 per ton of components, or roughly a fortnight of work per ton. A full repair or construction cradle, with robotic units that do most of the actual work, reduces the number of shifts per ton down to 2D+2.

## Installing, salvaging and scavenge components

Salvage can be obtained from wrecks or from vessels so decrepit they are sold for scrap. It may be possible to remove whole components – such as a stateroom or drive system – and install them elsewhere. Removing whole components, even if they have to be dismantled and reconstructed, is quicker than a full salvage job. It will take the same number of shifts to fully scavenge a component as it would to install it and 1D less shifts than this if the component can be removed as a functional unit and reinstalled. In this case it will be in the same condition as when it was in the original vessel if the Engineer check is made and one category worse if it is failed.

| Installing     | Just People         |                 |

##  Rating a Vessel 
If the Travellers are lucky enough to be crewing a swankboat fresh from the yards, they will use the standard Traveller system for recording their ship. Junkboats and rigs use the same system with additional information. If the Travellers want, they can record the condition of every single component aboard their ship and this may be necessary if they have used a mishmash of different bits and pieces. A ship whose drives are in good condition might also have a good quality stateroom but several others that are barely fit for human occupation. 

It is generally more convenient to note the quality of each general category within the vessel’s systems and to upgrade or replace components in blocks. The Travellers can go into as much detail as they like, bearing in mind that the jankiness of their ship is an important facet of this campaign. The condition of a component imposes a DM on all checks involving its use. 

For ships operated by non-Travellers, it is simplest to assign an overall quality level to the whole vessel, perhaps with one or more systems at a different quality level. DMs apply whenever they seem appropriate. 

For example, if the Travellers are making a first impression with a new client or some dignitary they would prefer to impress, their decrepit deathtrap of a vessel will impose a negative DM on reactions. 

Systems should be rated as blocks that have the same function. 

For example, if a ship has multiple passenger staterooms it is not desirable to rate each separately unless they are of differing quality in which case sub-groups can be created. Likewise specialist systems should be grouped, for example as cargo handling systems, drone operations systems and prospecting systems. 

In the event that a system takes damage it can only be repaired up to its current quality level. Improving it requires taking out the worst components and replacing them with better ones which goes beyond normal repair procedures. It is, however, possible to repair a system by upgrading it. 

For example, a vessel would normally have Hull 100 but it is in Janky condition and currently has Hull 65. Having taken damage in a crash, the vessel’s Hull is reduced to 45. It can be repaired back up to 65 but going beyond this point requires an upgrade. If the parts are available the crew could make a virtue of necessity and rip out the worst of the undamaged hull components along with the damaged ones, rebuilding at Basic quality and increasing to a maximum Hull 85.


## Component Condition
For craft and vessels whose components are in varying conditions, the overall condition of the vessel is determined by hull and power plant. The worst condition of these should be taken as indicative of the overall nonswankiness of the vessel.

### Component Quality Effects


| Component                | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hull                     | Hull is reduced to the percentage indicated by the quality level.                                                                                             |
| Manueuvre Drive          | DM applies to checks required for actions using the drive and Thrust is reduced to the percentage indicated by the quality level.                             |
| Jump Drive               | DM applies to checks required for actions using the drive. Jump capability remains absolute – jump 1, jump 2 and so forth.                                    |
| Power Plant              | DM applies to checks required for actions using the power plant. Power is reduced to the percentage indicated by the quality level.                           |

| Specialist Systems       | DM applies to checks required by actions with each named system, for example cargo handling system, prospecting sensor suite, or any other specialist system. |

## Constructing a Vessel 
It is entirely possible to put together a space vessel or even a starship without a proper yard. It takes a long time, however, and the end result might not be quite what the builder hoped for. A vessel put together in a yard will come out in Standard condition throughout – a swankboat in local parlance. Those cobbled together out in the wilds are unlikely to be in such good condition. Once construction is complete, the builder must determine the vessel’s condition. This can be a single roll for the whole vessel or key components may be determined individually. 

To determine the condition of a craft, roll 2D on the Component Quality table as usual. DM-4 is applied if the vessel was put together in a makeshift construction frame and DM-8 if it was constructed more or less by hand in orbit or on a landing pad somewhere. No DM applies if the vessel was built in a typical Estuary Cluster facility, with a very basic but serviceable construction cradle and most of the proper tools. 

The builder may apply the highest Engineer skill involved in the build as a positive DM. A result of 12+ may cause the craft to somehow come out better than intended but it is more likely the vessel will be in rather poor condition. A vessel that falls out of the construction frame in Busted condition is intact, more or less, but will require further work to make it spaceworthy. 

It is in theory possible to just start putting bits together and hope the end result is a space vessel but more commonly there is some kind of design process. If the Travellers choose to build their own vessel they should work out ahead of time how much space is to be allocated to each function. Some empty space can be left for cargo or future upgrades, and a vessel can be made spaceworthy without being fully fitted out, but overall the Travellers should have an idea of what they are trying to build. 

## Buying (or Otherwise Obtaining) a Vessel 
Vessels change hands from time-to-time for all manner of reasons. Lost bets, ownership in lieu of a debt, retirement and all manner of other circumstances can result in someone becoming a vessel owner. Often a craft will be too decrepit for its current owners and will be sold for salvage or rebuilding by someone willing to put in the time and locate the parts. This is where most of the vessels for sale in the yards of the cluster come from; they are recycled from much older craft. 

The asking price for a vessel will be determined by its condition and any unusual circumstances.

For example, a small craft in Janky condition will have a base price of 65% its good-condition cost. The Referee can modify this upward if the craft has some components in better condition and downward if some are worse. Other circumstances that lower price include a bad reputation for killing its crews, connection with some nefarious individual, or a need for a quick sale. 

Not all sellers are trustworthy and everyone tries to make what they are selling look as valuable as possible. Potential buyers are well advised to have a good crawl-around in the less accessible parts of a craft, where its true condition is more likely to be apparent. Some degree of bargaining is possible and it pays to go in armed with a clear impression of the vessel’s condition. In some cases the buyer will back out upon seeing what is behind the access panels. 

There is no simple mortgage system in the Estuary Cluster for buying spacecraft and even if there was no bank would touch the majority of vessels operating there. How Travellers get the money together for a ship is their problem; most operators start out with something small and in poor condition, and hope to ‘work up’ the vessel in use. This leads to painful decisions whether to upgrade now or save money in the hope of getting something better. 

There are other ways to obtain a vessel. Salvage is always an option, although a craft that has been abandoned is unlikely to be in very good condition. Enterprising Travellers might even build a vessel from scratch. Loan craft are possible, perhaps in return for an agreement to patch up the vessel while they use it. Every vessel operating in the Estuary Cluster has its own unique ‘origin story’.
